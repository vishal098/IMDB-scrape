IMDB-Movie-Scraper
In this project, I have Scraped a website (https://www.imdb.com/india/top-rated-indian-movies/?ref_=nv_mv_250_in) in which I have 250 movies.
I have used BeautifulSoup and Requests Library, in this u can see the movies_data based on years, decades, genres, directors, languages and casts.

Requirements for this
BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents.this is very useful for web scraping.

Requests Library
Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python. Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python.
